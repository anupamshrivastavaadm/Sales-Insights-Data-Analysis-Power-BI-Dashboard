Here are the steps which I follow to create a sales insights dashboard using Power BI:

Step 1: Connect to Data
The first step is to connect to sales data source. Power BI allows you to connect to a variety of data sources, such as Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, SQL databases, etc. Here I used MySql dataet which is provided by Codebasics. Once you connect to your data source, you can start importing your data into Power BI.

Step 2: Clean and Transform Data
After importing the data, the data needs to clean and transform it to make it more usable. Power BI offers a range of data transformation tools that allow you to clean, filter, and reshape your data. It can also use to create calculated columns and measures to derive new insights from your data.

Step 3: Design Dashboard
Next, I had started designing the dashboard. Power BI offers a range of visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, tables, and maps. You can select the appropriate visualization for your data and customize it to suit your needs. You can also add filters and slicers to make your dashboard more interactive.

Step 4: Publish and Share
Once the dashboard is created, It can be publish it to the Power BI service and share it with your colleagues or clients. Power BI offers a range of sharing options, such as sharing the dashboard through email or embedding it on a website. Here for publishing you need to have a business email.

Step 5: Analyze and Refine
Finally, you can analyze the insights generated from your dashboard and refine it further based on your findings. Power BI offers a range of analytics tools that allow you to explore your data in more detail and generate deeper insights.

By following these steps, you can create a powerful sales insights dashboard using Power BI and gain valuable insights into your sales performance.
